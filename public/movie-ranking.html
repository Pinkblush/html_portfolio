<h1>My favourite movies</h1>
<h2>These is a non-comprehensive list of movies that I enjoy!</h2>

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p> This thrilling series of movies follows the life of 
    a young Harry who discovers he is able to perform 
    magic. Harry and his close friends find themselves in 
    situations where the safety of their school and 
    that of the world as they know it is at risk and 
    they have to save the day!

<h3>Princess Diaries</h3>
<p> What about a princess who only finds out she is 
    a princess towards the end of her high schooling 
    years? Will she be able to juggle her  royal 
    responsibilities at a time when she is still 
    trying to understand herself as a person?

<h3>Ratatouille</h3>
<p> Think of your favourite meal. Now imagine it 
    was made by a rodent friend! That is the essence 
    of this movie. This particular rodent, a rat, 
    has rather well deeloped taste buds, while his 
    human companion does not! This makes for an 
    interesting turn of events.
